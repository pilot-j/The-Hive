"That is my shell, Tom!" she said. "You took it from me!"
Tom was confused and sad. He did not take the shell from Mia. He found it in the sand. He did not want to make Mia angry.
"No, Mia, I did not take your shell. I found it here. See, there are more shells like it." he said and pointed to the sand.
Mia did not believe him. She thought he was lying. She wanted her shell back. She tried to grab it from Tom's hand.
"Give me my shell, Tom! It is mine!" she said.

"Tom! Mia! Come here, please!" their mom said.

"Stop it, both of you! What is going on?" she said.
Tom and Mia both tried to explain. They both said the shell was theirs. They both said the other one was wrong.
Their mom looked at the shell. She recognized it too. She had seen it before. She knew who it belonged to.
"Tom, Mia, this shell is not yours. It is not mine. It is not anyone's. It is a shell that belongs to the sea. It is a gift that the sea gives us to enjoy, but not to keep. Do you understand?" she said.
Tom and Mia looked at the shell. They looked at their mom. They looked at each other. They felt sorry for fighting. They nodded.
"Yes, mom, we understand." they said.
Their mom smiled and hugged them. She gave them the shell to hold together.
"Good. Now, why don't you share this nice shell and look for more shells to admire? But remember, when we leave the beach, we have to leave the shells behind. They are not ours to take. They are the sea's to give." she said.

Tom was a cat who liked to play outside. He ran, jumped and chased birds and mice. He did not like to take baths or brush his fur. He thought he looked fine with his dirty, tangled coat.
One day, it was very cold and windy. Tom wanted to find a warm place to sleep. He saw a big house with a nice garden. He sneaked in through a hole in the fence. He saw a dog house with a soft blanket inside. He thought it was perfect for him.
He crawled into the dog house and curled up on the blanket. He felt cozy and happy. He did not know that the dog house belonged to Rex, a big, friendly dog who lived in the house.
Soon, Rex came back from his walk with his owner. He smelled a strange scent in his dog house. He barked and ran to see who was there. He saw Tom, the dirty cat, sleeping on his blanket. He was angry and scared.
"Who are you? Get out of my house!" Rex growled.
Tom woke up and saw Rex. He was terrified. He hissed and scratched Rex's nose. He tried to run away, but Rex blocked his way.
"Leave me alone! I just wanted to be warm!" Tom cried.
Rex and Tom fought and made a lot of noise. Their owner heard them and came to see what was wrong. He saw Rex and Tom, both hurt and scared. He picked up Tom and took him inside. He cleaned his wounds and gave him some food and water. He also gave him a bath and brushed his fur. He made him look clean and shiny.
He also checked on Rex and gave him a treat and a hug. He told him he was a good boy for protecting his house. He also told him he was sorry for the cat who was lost and cold.
He put Tom in a cage and called the animal shelter. He hoped they would find a good home for him. He felt sorry for him, but he knew he could not keep him. He already had Rex, who was his best friend.
Tom felt warm and full, but also sad and lonely. He wished he had a friend like Rex. He wished he had taken better care of himself. He realized he had been selfish and rude. He shivered in his cage and licked his paw. He hoped someone would love him and teach him how to be a good cat. He learned a hard lesson that day. He learned that being dirty and mean was not fun or smart. He learned that being clean and kind was better for him and others.

"Look, Ben, that cloud looks like a bunny!" Anna said, pointing at the sky.
"I see it, Anna, it has long ears and a fluffy tail!" Ben said, smiling.
They looked for more clouds that looked like things they knew. They recognized a car, a flower and a star. They were having fun.
Then they saw a big cloud that looked like nothing. It was just a big, white, fluffy cloud. It covered the sun and made the sky darker.
"What is that cloud, Anna?" Ben asked, feeling scared.
"I don't know, Ben, it is a strange cloud. Maybe it is a monster cloud!" Anna said, feeling scared too.
They hugged each other and wished the cloud would go away. They did not like the strange cloud.
But then the wind blew and the cloud moved. The sun came out again and made the sky bright and blue. The strange cloud was gone.
"Look, Ben, the sky is beautiful again!" Anna said, feeling happy.

Lily and Ben were playing in the garden. They liked to observe the bugs and the flowers. They saw a big mushroom under a tree. It was brown and round and had spots on it.
"Look, a mushroom!" Lily said. "Can we touch it?"
"I don't know," Ben said. "Maybe it is not good to touch. Mom said some mushrooms are bad."
Lily wanted to touch it anyway. She reached out her hand and poked the mushroom. It felt soft and wet. But then the mushroom broke and fell apart. Lily gasped.
"Oh no!" Ben said. "You broke the mushroom! What if it was someone's home? What if a bug lived there?"
Lily felt sorry. She did not mean to break the mushroom. She did not know it was so fragile. She looked at the pieces of the mushroom on the ground. She saw a small worm crawling out of one of them. She felt even more sorry.
"I'm sorry, worm," she said. "I'm sorry, mushroom. I did not want to hurt you. I was just curious."
Ben saw that Lily was sorry. He hugged her and said, "It's okay, Lily. You did not know. Maybe we can find another mushroom for the worm. Maybe we can help it find a new home."
Lily nodded. She wiped her tears and smiled. She and Ben looked around the garden for another mushroom. They found one that was smaller and white and had no spots. They carefully picked it up and brought it to the worm. They placed it near the broken mushroom and hoped the worm would like it.
"Here you go, worm," Lily said. "This is a new mushroom for you. We hope you are happy. We are sorry for breaking your old mushroom."
The worm wiggled and seemed to say thank you. Lily and Ben felt happy. They learned to be more careful with the things they observe. They also learned to say sorry when they make a mistake. They went back to playing in the garden, but they did not touch any more mushrooms. They just looked at them and admired their colors and shapes.

Lily and Ben liked to play pirates in the garden. They had a big box that was their ship, and a stick that was their sword. They also had a hook that they found in the shed. It was shiny and sharp, and they pretended it was a treasure.
One day, they decided to go on an adventure to find more treasure. They put on their hats and scarves, and took their ship, sword and hook with them. They walked around the garden, looking for clues. They saw a bird, a flower, a rock, but no treasure.
Then, they saw something shiny under a bush. They ran towards it, hoping it was gold or jewels. But when they got closer, they saw it was a frozen pond. It was very cold and slippery, and they could see fish and plants under the ice.
"Wow, look at that!" Lily said. "Maybe there is treasure under the ice!"
"Let's find out!" Ben said. He took the hook and tried to break the ice with it. He hit the ice hard, but it did not crack. He hit it again, and again, but nothing happened.
"Be careful, Ben!" Lily said. "You might fall in!"
Ben did not listen. He wanted to find the treasure. He hit the ice harder and harder, until he made a small hole. He looked inside, and saw something shiny. He reached for it with his hook, but he lost his balance. He slipped and fell into the pond.
Lily screamed. She saw Ben go under the water. She was very scared. She did not know what to do. She wanted to help Ben, but she did not want to fall in too. She looked around, and saw a big stick. She grabbed it, and ran to the pond. She lay down on the ice, and reached for Ben with the stick.
"Ben, Ben, grab the stick!" she shouted. "I'll pull you out!"
Ben heard Lily's voice. He was very cold and wet. He saw the stick, and grabbed it. Lily pulled him out of the pond. He was shivering and coughing. He dropped the hook, and hugged Lily.
"Thank you, Lily!" he said. "You saved me!"
"I'm sorry, Ben!" Lily said. "I should have been more polite. I should have let you have the hook. It was your treasure."
Ben shook his head. He smiled at Lily. He said, "No, Lily, you are my treasure. The hook was just a hook. It was not worth it. You are my best friend."
They hugged each other, and walked back to their ship. They decided to play pirates another day, when it was warmer and safer. They learned their lesson. They learned to be careful, and to share, and to be polite. They were happy.

Lily and Ben went to the park with Mom. They saw a big pond with many ducks and swans. Lily liked the swans. They were white and graceful. She wanted to feed them some bread.
"Mom, can I give some bread to the swans?" Lily asked.
"Sure, but be careful. Don't go too close to the water. And don't throw the bread too hard. The swans might get scared," Mom said.
Lily nodded and took a piece of bread from Mom. She walked slowly to the edge of the pond. She saw a swan swimming near her. She smiled and tossed the bread gently to the swan. The swan caught the bread and ate it. It looked happy.
"Thank you, swan!" Lily said.
The swan nodded and swam away. Lily looked for another swan to feed. She saw one that was hidden behind some reeds. It was smaller than the other swans. It looked shy.
"Hello, swan! Do you want some bread?" Lily called.
The hidden swan peeked out from the reeds. It saw Lily and the bread. It wanted the bread, but it was afraid of Lily. It stayed behind the reeds.
"Come on, swan! Don't be scared. I won't hurt you. I just want to be your friend," Lily said.
She threw the bread closer to the hidden swan. The hidden swan saw the bread. It was hungry. It decided to try the bread. It swam out from the reeds and took the bread. It tasted good.
"Thank you, Lily!" The hidden swan said.
Lily was surprised. She didn't know that swans could talk.
"You're welcome, swan! What's your name?" Lily asked.
"My name is End. I'm the last of my family. The other swans left me because I'm different. I can talk, but they can't," End said.
"That's sad, End. But you're not alone. You have me. I'm your friend. And you're not different. You're special," Lily said.
End smiled. He felt happy. He had a friend.
"Thank you, Lily. You're special too. Can I stay with you?" End asked.
"Of course, End. You can stay with me. Come on, let's go to Mom. She'll like you too," Lily said.
She took End's wing and led him to Mom. Ben saw them and was amazed.
"Wow, Lily! You have a talking swan!" Ben said.
"Yes, Ben. This is End. He's my friend. Can he play with us?" Lily said.
"Sure, Lily. He can play with us. Hi, End. I'm Ben. Nice to meet you," Ben said.
"Hi, Ben. Nice to meet you too. You're Lily's brother, right?" End said.
"Yes, I am. You're very smart, End," Ben said.
"Thank you, Ben. You're very kind, Ben," End said.
Mom saw them and was shocked.
"Lily, Ben, what's going on? Who's this swan?" Mom asked.
"Mom, this is End. He's a talking swan. He's my friend. Can he stay with us?" Lily said.
"A talking swan? That's incredible. How did you find him?" Mom asked.
"He was hidden behind some reeds. He was lonely. I gave him some bread. He thanked me. He told me his name. He asked me to be his friend. I said yes. He's very nice, Mom. Please, can he stay with us?" Lily said.
Mom looked at End. He looked at Mom. He nodded.
"Hello, Mom. I'm End. I'm a talking swan. I'm Lily's friend. Can I stay with you?" End said.
Mom was speechless. She didn't know what to say. She looked at Lily and Ben. They looked at Mom. They smiled.
"Please, Mom. Please," they said.
Mom sighed. She smiled too.
"Okay, okay. You can stay with us, End. But only if you promise to be good and not make too much noise. And you have to share the bread with the other swans. Deal?" Mom said.
"Deal, Mom. Thank you, Mom. You're very nice, Mom," End said.

Ben and Mia like to play in the big room with many books and papers. They see a big box with a lock on it. They want to know what is inside. They look for a key, but they cannot find one. They see a metal thing that looks like a stick. It is a file. They think it can open the lock.
They take the file and try to put it in the lock. They push and pull, but nothing happens. They hear a loud noise. It is a beep. They look at the box. It has a red light and a number. The number is going down. 10, 9, 8...
They do not know what it means. They are scared. They tremble. They want to run away, but they do not know how. The door is locked too. They scream for help, but no one hears them. The number is going down. 3, 2, 1...
The box explodes. It makes a big fire and a big boom. It hurts Ben and Mia. They fall down and do not get up. The box was dangerous. It was a bomb. Someone put it there to hurt people. Ben and Mia did not know. They just wanted to play. They are gone. The end.

"Tell her, tell her!" she says.

But then, a man comes to the park. He looks angry. He sees the box and the football.
"Hey, you kids!" he shouts. "That is my box and my football! Give them back to me!"
Ben and Tom are scared. They do not know the man. They do not want to give back the football.
"But we found them here," Ben says. "They are not yours."
"They are mine!" the man says. "I left them here for a while. They are very useful to me. The football is a gift for my son. The books are for my work. The toys and clothes are for charity. Now, give them back or I will call the police!"
Ben and Tom do not want to make the man more angry. They do not want to go to the police. They decide to give back the football and the box. They are sad. They liked the football.
"Sorry, mister," Tom says. "We did not know. Here is your football and your box."
The man takes the football and the box. He does not say thank you. He walks away.

Lily and Tom were playing with their toys in the living room. Lily had a big tank that could shoot balls and make noises. Tom had a small car that could go fast and beep. Lily liked her tank very much and did not want to share it with Tom. Tom liked the tank too and wanted to try it.
"Can I play with your tank, Lily?" Tom asked.
"No, it is mine. You have your car," Lily said.
"But your tank is so cool. Please, let me have a turn," Tom begged.
"No, go away. You are annoying," Lily said.
Tom felt sad and angry. He wanted to make Lily share. He had an idea. He took his car and drove it towards the tank. He bumped the tank hard and made it fall over. The balls flew out of the tank and rolled everywhere. The tank stopped making noises.
"Hey, what are you doing? You broke my tank!" Lily shouted.
"I wanted to play with it. You are mean," Tom said.
Lily was very mad. She grabbed her tank and threw it at Tom. The tank hit Tom on the head and made him cry. Tom dropped his car and held his head.
"Ow, that hurt. You are meaner," Tom said.
Lily and Tom started to yell at each other. They did not see their mom coming into the living room. She saw the mess and the tears and the toys.
"What is going on here? Why are you fighting?" Mom asked.
Lily and Tom stopped yelling and looked at Mom. They felt scared and sorry.
"We were playing with the tank and the car and we had a fight," Lily said.
"We both wanted the tank and we broke it and we threw it and we hurt each other," Tom said.
Mom sighed and shook her head. She picked up the tank and the car and put them on the table. She took a cloth and wiped the tears and the dirt from Lily and Tom's faces.
"You two need to learn how to share and be humble. The tank and the car are just toys. They are not worth hurting each other. You are brother and sister. You should love and help each other," Mom said.
Lily and Tom looked at each other. They felt ashamed and sorry.
"We are sorry, Mom. We are sorry, Lily. We are sorry, Tom," they said.
Mom smiled and hugged them. She gave them each a kiss and a cookie.
"That's better. Now, why don't you play something else together? Something nice and fun," Mom said.
Lily and Tom nodded and smiled. They took their cookies and went to their room. They decided to play with their blocks and make a castle. They shared and helped and had fun. They did not fight anymore. They were happy.

Lily and Tom were playing with their toys in the living room. They had a lot of fun making a big castle with blocks, cars, dolls and animals. They used glue to stick some parts together, so the castle would not fall down.
"Look, this is the king and the queen, and this is their baby princess," Lily said, showing Tom her dolls. "They live in the castle and they are very happy."
"That's nice, Lily," Tom said, nodding. "And this is the dragon, he is very big and strong. He protects the castle from bad guys. He can breathe fire and fly in the sky."
"Wow, Tom, your dragon is cool," Lily said, admiring his toy. "Can he be friends with the king and the queen?"
"Sure, he can," Tom said, smiling. "He is a good dragon, not a mean one. He likes the castle and the people in it."
They played for a while, making up stories and sounds for their toys. They were having a lot of fun, until they heard a loud noise from the kitchen.
"What was that?" Lily asked, scared.
"I don't know, let's go see," Tom said, curious.
They left their toys on the floor and ran to the kitchen. There they saw their big brother Sam, who had knocked over a jar of cookies and made a mess.
"Sam, what are you doing?" Lily asked, angry.
"I was hungry, and I wanted a cookie," Sam said, shrugging. "But the jar was too high, and I dropped it."
"You are so clumsy, Sam," Tom said, shaking his head. "You broke the jar and the cookies. Mom will be mad at you."
Sam looked at the broken jar and the crumbs on the floor. He felt bad and sorry. He didn't mean to make a mess. He wished he could fix it.
"Maybe we can help you, Sam," Lily said, kindly. "We have glue, we can glue the jar back together."
"Really? You would do that for me?" Sam asked, surprised.
"Sure, we would," Tom said, nodding. "You are our brother, and we love you. And glue is important, it can fix things."
They ran back to the living room and got the glue. They carefully glued the pieces of the jar together, and put the cookies back inside. They were very proud of their work.
"Thank you, Lily and Tom," Sam said, hugging them. "You are the best. You saved me from trouble."
"You're welcome, Sam," Lily and Tom said, smiling. "But next time, ask mom for a cookie, okay?"
"Okay, I will," Sam said, nodding. "And next time, can I play with you and your castle?"
"Okay, you can," Lily and Tom said, nodding. "But you have to be careful, and not break anything."
"Okay, I will," Sam said, nodding. "And I will protect the castle with you and your dragon."
They all laughed and hugged. They were happy and glad. They were a family, and they stuck together. Just like glue.

Lily and Tom were going to the park with Mom. They liked the park. They could play on the swings, slide down the slide, and run on the grass. They were very happy.
But on the way, they saw a cat. The cat was on the road. It looked scared and hurt. It had a cut on its leg. Lily and Tom felt sorry for the cat. They wanted to help it.
"Mom, can we stop and help the cat?" Lily asked.
"Of course, dear. We can delay going to the park for a little while. The cat needs our help. You are very compassionate, Lily and Tom," Mom said.
Mom parked the car and got out. She took a blanket and a bottle of water from the trunk. She gently wrapped the cat in the blanket and gave it some water. The cat purred and licked Mom's hand.
"Thank you, Mom. You are very kind," the cat seemed to say.
Lily and Tom smiled. They were glad the cat was feeling better. They petted the cat and talked to it softly.
"Can we take the cat home, Mom?" Tom asked.
"Well, we have to find out if the cat has a home already. Maybe it has a collar or a tag with its name and address. If not, we can take it to the vet and see if they can find its owner. If no one claims the cat, then maybe we can adopt it. How does that sound?" Mom asked.
Lily and Tom nodded. They liked that idea. They hoped the cat would be their new friend.
They got back in the car and drove to the vet. They did not mind delaying going to the park. They had found a better way to spend their day. They had shown compassion to a cat in need. And they had learned a valuable lesson. Sometimes, helping others is more fun than playing.

Mom hears the noises and comes to see what they are doing. She sees the umbrella on the floor and the twins under it. She smiles and says they are very clever. She asks if they want to play a game with her. They say yes, they want to play.
Mom takes the umbrella and holds it over her head. She says she is a giant and they are tiny ants. She pretends to chase them around the room. They run and hide and laugh. They wave at mom and she waves back. They have fun and forget about the rain. They are not bored anymore.

"Mom, can I invite Sam and Lily and Ben and Anna to my party?" he said.
"Of course, my dear. You can invite whoever you want. It's your special day," his mom said.
"Can I invite Aunt Lucy too?" he said.
His mom frowned. She did not like Aunt Lucy. Aunt Lucy was ignorant. She always said mean things to Tommy and his mom. She did not know how to be nice.
"Tommy, I don't think Aunt Lucy would enjoy your party. She doesn't like fun things. She likes to sit and complain. She might make you and your friends unhappy," his mom said.
"But she is my aunt. She is family. Maybe she will be happy if I invite her. Maybe she will be nice to me," Tommy said.
His mom sighed. She loved Tommy very much. She wanted him to be happy. She did not want to hurt his feelings.
"Okay, Tommy. If you really want to invite Aunt Lucy, you can. But don't be sad if she doesn't come or if she is rude. You have many other people who love you and who will celebrate with you," his mom said.

Sara liked to help her mom in the kitchen. She liked to stir the soup, cut the bread, and taste the cheese. But she did not like onions. Onions made her cry and smell bad. She always tried to hide them under her plate or give them to the dog.
One day, mom asked Sara to spend some time with her dad in the garden. She said they had to pick some onions for dinner. Sara did not want to go, but she did not want to make mom sad. She put on her boots and hat and followed dad outside.
The garden was huge. There were many plants and flowers and bugs. Sara liked to look at them and touch them. But she did not like the onions. They were big and round and had long green hair. Dad said they were good for the soup and the salad and the meat. He gave Sara a basket and a knife and told her to cut some onions.
Sara did not want to cut the onions. She wanted to play with the bugs and the flowers. She looked around and saw a butterfly. It was yellow and black and very pretty. She ran after it, leaving the basket and the knife behind.
Dad did not see Sara run away. He was busy cutting onions. He filled the basket with many onions. He was proud of his work. He wanted to show mom and Sara how many onions he had. He picked up the basket and the knife and walked back to the house.
Sara followed the butterfly to the other side of the garden. She saw a big tree with red apples. She liked apples. They were sweet and juicy and crunchy. She wanted to have one. She climbed the tree and reached for an apple.
But she did not see the bee. The bee was on the apple. It was angry and scared. It did not like Sara. It stung Sara on the nose. Sara screamed and fell from the tree. She dropped the apple and the butterfly flew away.
Dad heard Sara scream. He dropped the basket and the knife and ran to Sara. He saw her on the ground, crying and holding her nose. He saw the bee and the apple and the tree. He understood what happened. He felt sorry for Sara. He hugged her and kissed her and said:
"It's okay, Sara. It's just a bee sting. It will go away soon. You are brave and strong. I love you, Sara."
Sara looked at dad. She saw his eyes and his smile and his beard. She smelled his breath and his shirt and his hair. She smelled the onions. She did not like the onions. But she liked dad. She loved dad. She said:
"I love you too, dad. But I don't like onions."

Lucy was so scared that she started to cry. The fairy was very kind and gently explained to Lucy that she needed the pin to help manage her magic. She asked Lucy if she would kindly give it back. Lucy wiped away her tears and managed to do it.
The fairy thanked her and waved her wand. As a reward for being so brave, Lucy received a special gift. Then the fairy waved her wand again and flew away, leaving Lucy with her surprise.

Sara was a girl who liked to help others. She often visited her grandpa, who lived in a small house near the park. Grandpa had a cane that he used to walk, because his legs were not very strong. Sara admired grandpa, because he was always kind and wise.
One day, Sara and grandpa went to the park to feed the ducks. Sara brought some bread and grandpa brought his cane. They walked slowly and carefully, enjoying the sun and the flowers. When they reached the pond, they saw a boy who was crying. He had a bike, but one of the wheels was broken.
"What's wrong, little boy?" grandpa asked.
"I was riding my bike, and then it hit a rock and the wheel came off. Now I can't ride it anymore, and I don't have anyone to help me fix it," the boy said.
"That's too bad," grandpa said. "But don't worry, maybe we can help you. Sara, do you have any tools in your backpack?"
Sara nodded. She always carried a small toolbox with her, because she liked to fix things. She opened her backpack and took out a wrench and a screwdriver. She looked at the bike and saw that the wheel was only loose, not broken. She tightened the screws and put the wheel back on.
"There, it's fixed!" she said, smiling.
"Wow, thank you so much!" the boy said. "You are very smart and nice. What's your name?"
"I'm Sara, and this is my grandpa. He has a cane, but he is very kind and wise," Sara said.
"I'm Ben, and I'm very grateful. Can I be your friend?" Ben asked.
"Of course, we can be friends. Do you want to feed the ducks with us?" Sara asked.
"Yes, I would love that!" Ben said.
So Sara, grandpa, and Ben fed the ducks and had a lot of fun. They learned that they had many things in common, and they decided to meet again soon. Sara was happy that she had helped someone and made a new friend. She realized that being helpful and friendly was more important than having a perfect bike or a strong cane. She hugged grandpa and thanked him for teaching her that lesson.
The moral of the story is: Helping others and being friendly can make you happy and earn you new friends.

You have to love them and not hurt them. Do you understand?"

She said to her mom, "I'm sorry, mom. I'm sorry, flower. I didn't know. I didn't mean to. I won't do it again. I will be gentle and kind. I will respect and love the flowers. Please forgive me."
Her mom hugged her. She said, "I forgive you, Lily. But you have to learn from your mistake. You have to be more careful and responsible. You have to think before you act. You have to remember that flowers are living things. They have feelings and needs. They are not toys. They are gifts from nature. They are beautiful and precious. They make us happy and grateful. They deserve our care and respect. Can you promise me that?"
Lily hugged her mom back. She said, "I promise, mom. I promise, flower. I will learn from my mistake. I will be more careful and responsible. I will think before I act. I will remember that flowers are living things. I will care and respect them. I will thank them for their beauty and joy. I love you, mom. I love you, flower."

She opened the cabinet door and saw Tom. He smiled and said, "You found me!" Anna said, "Yes, I did. But why did you hide in there? It is dark and scary." Tom said, "No, it is not. It is safe and cozy. There are pots and pans and plates and cups. They keep me company." Anna said, "But they are not alive. They cannot talk to you or play with you. And what if Mom or Dad need something from the cabinet? They will be surprised to see you in there."
Tom said, "I don't care. I like it here. It is my secret place. You can join me if you want." Anna said, "No, thank you. I don't like it here. It is too small and stuffy. I prefer to play outside or in the toy room. There are more things to do and see. And I don't want to leave Mom and Dad alone. They might worry about us." Tom said, "Fine. Then you can leave. I will stay here." Anna said, "OK. But don't stay too long. It is not good for you. And don't forget to come out when Mom or Dad call us for lunch." She closed the cabinet door and left.
Tom stayed in the cabinet for a while. He pretended that the pots and pans and plates and cups were his friends. He made up stories and songs with them. He had fun. But after some time, he started to feel bored and lonely. He missed Anna and Mom and Dad. He wondered what they were doing. He wanted to play with them.

We love you and we want you to be with us." Tom said, "I love you too. And I want to be with you too. The cabinet is not my secret place anymore. It is just a cabinet." They smiled and said, "That's right. It is just a cabinet. And you are our precious son." They played and talked and had lunch together. Tom felt happy and warm.

"Wait for me!" Anna said. She followed him with a net in her hand. She was afraid of the crab. It had big claws and eyes on stalks.

Ben reached the rock first. He put his bucket down and lifted the rock. He saw the crab and smiled. He reached for it with his hand.
"Stop!" Anna shouted. She saw something shiny under the sand. She thought it was a shell. She bent down and picked it up.
It was not a shell. It was a whistle. It made a loud noise when she blew it.
The noise scared the crab. It snapped its claws at Ben's hand. Ben screamed and dropped the rock. He ran away from the crab.
The noise also scared a seagull. It was flying over the beach. It saw the crab and thought it was food. It swooped down and grabbed the crab in its beak.

Tom was a chubby boy who liked to cook with his mom. He helped her stir the soup in the big pot on the stove. He liked to watch the steam go up in the air and smell the yummy food.
One day, Tom wanted to make his own soup. He found a small pot and some water and put it on the stove. He added some salt and pepper and some things he found in the fridge. He stirred and stirred and waited for his soup to be ready.
But he forgot to turn down the heat. The water boiled and boiled and spilled over the pot. It made a big mess and a lot of smoke. The smoke alarm went off and made a loud noise. Tom got scared and ran to his mom.
Mom saw the smoke and the mess and turned off the stove. She was not happy with Tom. She told him he should never cook alone and he could have burned himself or the house. She hugged him and said she was glad he was okay.
Tom felt sorry and said he was sorry too. He helped mom clean up the mess and promised to be more careful next time. Mom said she loved him and they could cook together again later.

Lily and Ben were playing in the park. They liked to pretend they were astronauts and fly to the moon. They had a big cardboard box that they used as a rocket. They painted it with bright colors and stuck stars and planets on it.
"Ready for blast off?" Ben asked Lily. He was the pilot and she was the co-pilot.
"Ready!" Lily said. She put on her helmet and pressed some buttons. "Five, four, three, two, one, go!"
They made loud noises as they lifted off the ground. They imagined they were zooming through the sky and seeing all kinds of wonders. They laughed and cheered as they reached the moon.
"Wow, look at that!" Lily said, pointing to a big crater. "Let's go explore!"
They got out of the rocket and jumped around. They felt very light and happy. They picked up some rocks and threw them in the air. They saw a flag and a footprint. They wondered who had been there before.
Suddenly, they heard a loud voice. It was Lily's mom. She was calling them from the park gate.
"Lily, Ben, time to go home! It's getting cold and dark!"
Lily and Ben looked at each other. They were upset. They didn't want to leave their rocket and their moon adventure. They wanted to stay and play some more.
"Can we have five more minutes, please?" Lily asked.
"No, you can't. It's too late. Come on, hurry up!" Lily's mom said.
Lily and Ben sighed. They got back into their rocket and pretended to land. They got out of the box and dragged it to the gate. They were sad and angry.
They passed by a fountain on the way. They saw some water spraying out of it. They had an idea.
"Let's freeze the fountain!" Ben whispered to Lily.
"How?" Lily asked.
"Watch this!" Ben said. He took a deep breath and blew as hard as he could at the fountain. He made a freezing sound.
Lily did the same. They both blew and blew until they ran out of air. They looked at the fountain. It was still spraying water.
They frowned. It didn't work. They felt silly.
They heard Lily's mom laughing. She had seen them trying to freeze the fountain.
"What are you doing, you silly geese?" she asked.
"We were trying to freeze the fountain, like astronauts!" Lily said.
"Astronauts don't freeze fountains, they explore space!" Lily's mom said.
"Well, we did that too!" Ben said.
"Really? Tell me all about it!" Lily's mom said.
Lily and Ben smiled. They forgot their upset feelings. They told Lily's mom all about their rocket and their moon adventure. They showed her their rocks and their flag. They made her laugh with their noises and their jumps.
Lily's mom hugged them and praised them for their imagination and creativity. She told them they were very clever and brave astronauts. She said they could play with their rocket again tomorrow, if they wanted.
Lily and Ben felt happy again. They thanked Lily's mom and said goodbye. They went home with their parents, holding their rocket and their rocks. They looked at the sky and saw the moon shining. They waved at it and smiled. They had a lot of fun today. They couldn't wait for tomorrow.

But then, the miller came and saw them. He was angry and shouted. "What are you doing with my flour? You are making a mess and wasting my work! Go away and don't come back!"
Tom and Sue were scared and ran away. They felt sorry and ashamed. They knew they did a bad thing. They did not ask the miller if they could play with his flour. They did not respect his property.
They went to their homes and told their parents what happened. Their parents were also angry and disappointed. They made them go back to the mill and apologize to the miller. They also made them help him clean the mess and fix the sack.

Tom did not want to give the dinosaur back. He liked it too much. He said, "No, it is mine now. You gave it to me."
Lily was angry. She said, "No, I did not. I lent it to you. That means you have to give it back. It is not fair."

The teacher heard the noise and came to see what was wrong. She saw the broken dinosaur and the two crying children. She asked them what happened. They told her their story.
The teacher was disappointed. She said, "Tom, you should not be envious of Lily's toy. You should be happy for her. And you should not keep something that is not yours. You should respect Lily's feelings. Lily, you should not lend your toy if you are not ready to share it. You should be careful with your things. And you should not fight over a toy. You should be kind to each other."
Tom and Lily felt sorry. They said, "We are sorry, teacher. We are sorry, Lily. We are sorry, Tom."
The teacher said, "It is OK. I am glad you are sorry. But you have to learn from this. You have to be good friends and share and care. And you have to fix the dinosaur. Maybe you can glue it together and make it roar again."
Tom and Lily nodded. They hugged each other and said, "We are friends. We will fix the dinosaur. We will play together."
The teacher smiled. She said, "That is good. I am proud of you. Now, let's go to the library and read a book about history and dinosaurs. Maybe you will find some more toys to play with."

"Here is your rice with chicken and broccoli, sir," Lily says, giving a plate to her teddy bear. "Enjoy your meal!"
"Thank you, chef Lily. This looks delicious," the teddy bear says.

"Here is your rice with cheese and ham, madam," Max says, giving a plate to his doll. "This is the best dish in the town!"
"Thank you, chef Max. This smells wonderful," the doll says.
Lily and Max look at each other's dishes and start to argue. They think their own dish is better and more tasty. They try to convince their customers to switch plates.
"Hey, teddy bear, do you want to try my rice with cheese and ham? It is much more yummy than Lily's rice with chicken and broccoli," Max says.
"No, thank you, chef Max. I like Lily's dish. It has more vegetables and protein," the teddy bear says.
"Hey, doll, do you want to try my rice with chicken and broccoli? It is much more healthy and colorful than Max's rice with cheese and ham," Lily says.
"No, thank you, chef Lily. I like Max's dish. It has more cheese and flavor," the doll says.

Their mom smiles and hugs them.
"It's okay, Lily and Max. I'm glad you like to play pretend and be creative. But you also have to remember to be kind and cooperative. You can make different dishes with rice, but you can also try each other's dishes and learn from each other. And you have to clean up after yourselves," their mom says.
Lily and Max nod and agree.
"Okay, mom. We will clean up the mess and we will try each other's dishes. And we will say sorry to our customers," Lily says.
"Okay, mom. We will clean up the mess and we will try each other's dishes. And we will say thank you to our customers," Max says.

"Your rice with chicken and broccoli is good, Lily. I like the chicken and the broccoli," Max says.

"Lily, listen to me. The zipper is not a toy. It is a part of your coat. If you zip it too much, it will get tired and stop working. Then you will not be able to wear your coat anymore. Do you want that?"
Lily thought for a moment. She did not want to lose her coat. She liked her coat. It was warm and soft and had a big zipper. She decided to listen to Mommy. She zipped up her coat and left it alone.

They reached the end of the tunnel. They saw a small opening. Sara said, "Ben, look! We can go out here. But we have to squeeze. It is very small."
Ben looked at the opening. He was not sure. He said, "Will we fit, Sara?"
Sara said, "Yes, we will. I will go first. You can follow me. Push hard. We can do it."
Ben nodded. He watched Sara squeeze through the opening. She made it. She smiled and said, "Come on, Ben. You can do it too."
Ben pushed hard. He squeezed through the opening. He made it too. He smiled and said, "We did it, Sara. We did it!"

"What did you do?" he yelled. He looked at Lily and saw that she was laughing. She had the juice and she did not care that she made a mess.
Ben felt cold and mad. He wanted to make Lily feel sorry. He got up and ran to the bathroom. He saw a big roll of toilet paper on the shelf. He had an idea.

Anna and Ben were playing with their dolls. Anna had a princess doll with a pink dress and a crown. Ben had a pirate doll with a hook and a hat.
"Let's pretend that the pirate wants to marry the princess," Anna said.
"Okay, but the princess does not like the pirate," Ben said.
"Why not?" Anna asked.
"Because he is fat and mean," Ben said.
Anna did not like that Ben said that. She liked fat people. Her grandma was fat and she was very nice. She also liked pirates. They had cool stories and songs.
"That is not nice, Ben. You should not say that about people. Fat people can be good and pirates can be fun," Anna said.
"But the princess does not think so. She thinks the pirate is ugly and scary," Ben said.
"How do you know that? Did she mention that to you?" Anna asked.
Ben did not know what mention meant. He thought it was a big word that Anna used to sound smart. He did not like that Anna used big words. He wanted to play with simple words.
"No, she did not mention that to me. She did not talk to me at all. She only talks to the prince," Ben said.
"Who is the prince?" Anna asked.
"The prince is the other doll that I have. He is handsome and brave. He has a sword and a horse. He loves the princess and the princess loves him," Ben said.
He showed Anna his other doll. It was a prince doll with a blue coat and a feather. Anna did not like the prince doll. She thought he was boring and snooty. She did not like blue. She liked pink.
"That is not fair, Ben. You have two dolls and I only have one. You should share your dolls with me. I want to play with the pirate too," Anna said.
"No, you cannot play with the pirate. He is mine. You can only play with the princess. She is yours," Ben said.
He grabbed the pirate doll from Anna's hand. Anna did not like that Ben grabbed her doll. She felt angry and sad. She wanted to play with both dolls. She did not want to play with Ben anymore.
"Fine, then I do not want to play with you anymore. You are mean and selfish. You do not know how to share. I will play with someone else," Anna said.
She took her princess doll and ran away. Ben did not care. He thought Anna was silly and bossy. He did not want to play with her anymore. He played with his pirate and his prince by himself. He thought they were the best dolls ever. He did not need anyone else.

Lily and Max were twins who liked to play with puzzles. They had many puzzles with different pictures, like animals, cars, and flowers. They also liked to wear funny hats and costumes when they played.
One day, they found a new puzzle in their toy box. It was a puzzle of a big green monster with sharp teeth and red eyes. Lily and Max wanted to try it, but they had a problem. They only had one hat that matched the puzzle. It was a green hat with horns and ears.
Lily said, "I want to wear the green hat and do the puzzle. It is my turn." Max said, "No, I want to wear the green hat and do the puzzle. It is my turn." They both grabbed the hat and pulled it. The hat ripped in half.
Lily and Max were very sad and angry. They threw the hat and the puzzle pieces on the floor. They said, "This hat is disgusting. This puzzle is disgusting. We don't want to play with them anymore."
Mom heard the noise and came to see what was wrong. She saw the mess and the tears. She said, "What happened here? Why are you fighting?" Lily and Max told her what happened. Mom said, "I'm sorry you ripped your hat. But you shouldn't fight over toys. You should share and take turns. And you shouldn't say things are disgusting. They are just different. Maybe you can find something else to wear and do the puzzle together."
Lily and Max felt sorry for what they did. They said, "We're sorry, Mom. We're sorry, hat. We're sorry, puzzle." They hugged Mom and each other. They picked up the hat and the puzzle pieces.

Ben liked to look for insects in the garden. He had a jar with holes in the lid, and he wanted to fill it with different kinds of insects. He liked to watch them crawl and fly and make noises.
One day, he saw a big, shiny insect on a flower. It had four wings and a long tail. It was green and blue and yellow. Ben thought it was the most beautiful insect he had ever seen. He wanted to catch it and put it in his jar.
He ran to the flower and reached out his hand. But before he could grab the insect, he heard a loud buzz and felt a sharp pain in his finger. He screamed and dropped the jar. The insect flew away.
"Ow, ow, ow!" Ben cried. He ran to his mom, who was sitting on the porch. She saw his finger and hugged him.
"What happened, Ben?" she asked.
"I tried to catch a pretty insect, but it stung me!" Ben sobbed.
"Oh, Ben, I'm sorry. That was a bee. Bees are not good insects to catch. They can hurt you. They make honey, but they also have stingers. You have to be careful around them."
She took him inside and put some ice on his finger. She gave him a cookie and a glass of milk. She kissed his finger and his cheek.
"Next time, I recommend you look for other insects, like butterflies or ladybugs. They are also pretty, but they don't sting. They are more available and friendly. Do you understand?"
Ben nodded. He felt better. He learned his lesson. He decided to leave the bees alone and look for other insects. He hoped he would find a butterfly or a ladybug soon. He still liked insects, but he was more careful now.

Lily and Ben were scared of the big boy. He was much taller and stronger than them. He looked mean and angry. They did not want to give him their dolls. They loved their dolls very much.
The big boy grabbed Lily's doll. It was a soft pink bunny with a leather jacket. Lily had made the jacket herself with her mom's help. She cried, "No, please, don't take my bunny. She is my best friend. She is not babyish. She is cool and brave."
The big boy laughed. He said, "A bunny with a leather jacket? That is silly. Bunnies are not cool or brave. They are weak and scared. This is a dangerous jacket. It is only for tough guys like me. You can have this doll instead." He threw a dirty rag doll at Lily.
Lily did not accept the rag doll. She threw it back at the big boy. She said, "No, thank you. I don't want your doll. She is not my friend. She is dirty and ugly. You can keep her. Give me back my bunny. She is not dangerous. She is kind and sweet."
Ben saw that Lily was brave. He decided to be brave too. He said, "Yeah, give us back our dolls. They are ours. You are not nice. You are mean and rude. Go away and leave us alone."
The big boy was surprised. He did not expect Lily and Ben to stand up to him. He felt ashamed and scared. He said, "Fine, fine, take your dolls. I don't want them anyway. They are stupid and boring. I have better toys at home." He ran away from the park.
Lily and Ben hugged their dolls. They were happy and proud. They said, "We did it. We saved our dolls. We are cool and brave. We are best friends." They continued to play with their dolls and have fun. They did not let the big boy bother them again.

Lily and Tom were friends who liked to draw. They had many crayons and papers to make pictures. One day, they decided to draw symbols. Symbols are shapes that mean something. For example, a heart means love, and a star means wish.
Lily drew a heart and said, "This is a symbol for love. I love my family and my friends." Tom drew a star and said, "This is a symbol for wish. I wish I could fly like a bird." They showed each other their symbols and smiled.
Then, Tom had an idea. He drew a circle with a line and said, "This is a symbol for laugh. I like to laugh and have fun." Lily liked Tom's symbol and drew one too. They laughed and made more symbols for laugh.
But then, Lily saw a symbol that Tom drew that she did not like. It was a square with a cross and a dot. She asked, "What is this symbol, Tom?" Tom said, "This is a symbol for Lily. You are a square because you are boring, a cross because you are mean, and a dot because you are small."
Lily felt hurt and angry. She said, "That is not a nice symbol, Tom. That is a mean symbol. You are not my friend." She grabbed her papers and crayons and ran away. Tom felt sorry and sad. He realized he had made a mistake.
He ran after Lily and said, "Lily, wait. I'm sorry. I was just joking. I did not mean to hurt you. You are not a mean symbol. You are a nice symbol. You are a flower because you are beautiful, a sun because you are bright, and a heart because you are kind."
Lily stopped and looked at Tom. She saw that he had drawn a new symbol for her. It was a flower, a sun, and a heart. She felt happy and forgave him. She said, "Thank you, Tom. You are a nice symbol too. You are a star because you are special, a cloud because you are soft, and a laugh because you are funny."
They hugged and made up. They went back to their drawing and made more symbols for each other. They learned that symbols can be nice or mean, and that they should always be kind to their friends.
The moral of the story is: Be careful with your words. They can hurt or heal.

"Thank you, Tom. Mint smells nice. I like tea. What is this herb?" Lily asks. She points to another plant. It has purple flowers and green leaves.
"That is lavender. It is also a herb. You can give it to your dad. He can put it in his pillow. It can help him sleep," Tom says. He picks some lavender flowers and gives them to Lily.
"Thank you, Tom. Lavender is pretty. I like sleep. Are there more herbs?" Lily asks. She looks around the garden.
"Yes, there are. But we have to ask the gardener first. He knows which herbs are available. Some herbs are not for picking. They are for the bees and the birds," Tom says. He holds Lily's hand and they walk to the gardener.

Sam was a little boy who liked to play with his toys. He had many toys, but his favorite was a red car that could make loud noises and go fast. He always took his car with him everywhere, even to bed.
One day, his mom told him that they had to move to a new house. Sam was sad and scared. He did not want to leave his old house and his friends. He did not want to sleep in a new room. He did not want to pack his toys.
"Mom, why do we have to move?" he asked.
"Because, Sam, daddy got a new job. He will work in a big building and make more money. We will have a bigger house and a nicer yard. You will have your own room upstairs. You will make new friends. You will like it there, I promise." his mom said.
Sam did not believe her. He did not care about money or yards or rooms. He only cared about his car. He decided to hide his car under his pillow and not pack it. He thought that if he kept his car, he could stay in his old house.
The next day, they got in the car and drove to the new house. Sam was angry and quiet. He did not look out the window or talk to his mom or dad. He held his car tightly in his hand.
When they arrived, his mom and dad showed him his new room upstairs. It was big and bright, with a blue wall and a yellow bed. There were many boxes with his toys and clothes.
"Look, Sam, this is your new room. Isn't it nice? You can put your toys wherever you want. You can play with them anytime. You can have fun here." his dad said.
Sam did not like his new room. He did not want to put his toys anywhere. He did not want to play with them. He did not want to have fun. He threw his car on the floor and ran downstairs. He cried and screamed.
"Sam, what's wrong? Why are you so upset?" his mom asked.
"I hate it here! I want to go back! I want my old house! I want my old room! I want my old friends! I don't want to grow up!" he shouted.
"Sam, I know you miss your old house and your old friends. But you can't go back. You have to grow up. Growing up is not bad. It means you can do more things. You can learn new things. You can meet new people. You can be powerful. You can be happy. You have to give it a chance." his mom said.
Sam did not listen to his mom. He did not want to do more things. He did not want to learn new things. He did not want to meet new people. He did not want to be powerful. He did not want to be happy. He only wanted his car.
He ran to his new room and picked up his car. He hugged it and whispered to it.
"You are my only friend. You are the only thing I need. You make me happy. You make me powerful. You will never leave me. You will never change. You will never grow up." he said.
But as he said that, something strange happened. His car started to grow. It grew bigger and bigger, until it was as big as Sam. It made louder and louder noises, until it hurt Sam's ears. It went faster and faster, until it dragged Sam along. It smashed the boxes, the toys, the clothes, the wall, the window. It broke everything in its way.
Sam was scared and sorry. He did not want his car to grow. He did not want his car to be powerful. He did not want his car to break everything. He wanted his car to stop. He wanted his car to be small and quiet and slow again. He wanted his car to be his toy, not his boss.
He tried to let go of his car, but it was too strong. It held him tight and did not listen to him. It took him outside, where it saw more things to break. It saw the yard, the fence, the street, the cars, the people. It wanted to break them all.
Sam cried and screamed. He called for his mom and dad. He called for help. He wished he had listened to his mom. He wished he had given his new house a chance. He wished he had grown up a little.
Then, he heard a loud siren. He saw a big truck with a red light and a long hose. He saw a man in a yellow suit and a big hat. He saw a fireman.
The fireman saw Sam and his car. He saw the damage they had done. He saw the danger they were in. He acted quickly. He turned

Ben and Mia liked to play near the park. The park had a big pond with ducks and fish. The park also had a rail that stopped people from falling into the pond. Ben and Mia's mom always told them to stay away from the rail and not to climb on it.
One day, Ben and Mia saw some older kids climbing on the rail. They looked like they were having fun. Ben wanted to join them, but Mia was scared. She said, "Mom said no. It is not safe. We can fall and get hurt."
Ben said, "Mom is not here. She will not know. I want to try. It looks easy." He ran to the rail and started to climb on it. Mia followed him and said, "Please, Ben, come back. It is not good. You are not listening."
But Ben did not listen. He climbed higher and higher on the rail. He felt brave and happy. He said, "Look at me, Mia. I am so high. I can see everything."
Mia said, "Ben, be careful. The rail is not strong. It can break. You can fall."
But Ben did not hear her. He was too busy looking around. He did not see that the rail was old and rusty. He did not see that it was shaking and cracking. He did not see that it was about to snap.
Suddenly, the rail broke. Ben screamed and fell into the pond. He splashed and sank. He was scared and cold. He could not swim. He could not breathe.
Mia saw what happened. She was calm and smart. She ran to the older kids and asked for help. They called for a grown-up. The grown-up came and jumped into the pond. He grabbed Ben and pulled him out. He gave him a towel and checked if he was okay.
Ben was wet and shivering. He was sorry and sad. He said, "Thank you, sir. Thank you, Mia. I was wrong. I should have listened to mom. I should have listened to you. I was not safe. I was not good."
Mia hugged him and said, "It is okay, Ben. I am glad you are okay. I love you. But next time, please do not climb on the rail. It is not fun. It is dangerous."
Ben nodded and said, "I promise, Mia. I learned my lesson. I will not do it again. I will be good."
The moral of the story is: Do not do things that are not permitted. They can be harmful and hurtful. Listen to your mom and your sister. They know what is best for you. Be calm and smart. Ask for help when you need it.

Nina liked to look at the stars at night. She wondered how they could shine so bright and far away. She asked her mom, "Mom, why do the stars shine?"
Mom smiled and hugged Nina. She said, "The stars shine because they are very hot and big. They are like big balls of fire in the sky. They give us light and make the night beautiful."
Nina nodded and said, "I like the stars. They are pretty and unique. They are not like anything else."
Mom said, "That's true, Nina. The stars are unique, just like you. You are also pretty and unique. You have your own body, your own mind, and your own heart. No one else is like you. You are special and I love you."

Tom and Lily were twins who liked to play together. They had many toys, but their favorite was a big box of crayons. They liked to draw and color on paper, on the wall, and sometimes on each other.
One day, they decided to try something new. They took a pair of scissors from their mom's desk and started to cut their crayons. They wanted to see what was inside them. They cut the red crayon, the blue crayon, the yellow crayon, and all the other colors. They were surprised to discover that all the crayons had the same thing inside: a white stick.
"Look, Lily, all the crayons are the same inside!" Tom said.
"That's weird, Tom, they look so different outside!" Lily said.
They cut more and more crayons, until they had a pile of white sticks and colorful pieces. They tried to put them back together, but they could not. They had broken their crayons.
Mom came into the room and saw the mess. She was not happy. She scolded Tom and Lily for cutting their crayons and wasting them. She told them to clean up and to never use scissors without asking. She also told them that they should not judge things by their outside, but by their inside.
Tom and Lily felt sorry for what they had done. They apologized to Mom and to their crayons. They learned that cutting things was not fun, and that different things could have the same value. They promised to be more careful and respectful with their toys and with each other.

Lily liked to help her mom in the kitchen. She wanted to work like a big girl. She saw her mom cut some carrots with a knife. Lily asked, "Can I cut too?"
Mom smiled and said, "No, Lily, cutting is not for little hands. You can use a fork to poke the carrots. That is your work."
Lily took a fork and poked the carrots. She liked the sound they made. She poked and poked until all the carrots were on a plate. She was very patient and careful.
Mom said, "Good job, Lily! You worked very well. Now we can cook the carrots for dinner. Do you want to stir them in the pot?"
Lily nodded and said, "Yes, please!" She put down her fork and climbed on a stool. Mom gave her a wooden spoon and showed her how to stir. Lily stirred and stirred until the carrots were soft and yummy.
Mom said, "You are a great helper, Lily. I am proud of you. Now we can eat the carrots. Do you want some?"
Lily said, "Yes, please! I love carrots. They are my favorite." She took her fork and ate some carrots. She shared them with her mom. They were both happy and full.

One day, a boy named Tom went to the zoo with his mom and dad. He liked to see all the animals, but his favorite was the big gorilla. He wanted to talk to the gorilla and be his friend.
He went close to the glass and said, "Hello, gorilla. You are so big and strong. Can I play with you?"
The gorilla looked at Tom and made a funny sound. He showed his teeth and beat his chest. He wanted to show Tom that he was the boss.
Tom felt scared and ran back to his mom and dad. He said, "The gorilla is mean and loud. He does not want to play with me."
His mom and dad hugged him and said, "Don't be sad, Tom. The gorilla is not mean. He is just humble. He does not like to show off or brag. He is happy with what he has. He does not need to play with you. He has his own friends and family in the zoo."
Tom felt better and said, "I understand, mom and dad. The gorilla is humble and happy. I am humble and happy too. I have you and my friends and toys. Maybe next time, the gorilla will smile at me."

Tom and Lily were friends. They liked to play in the park. One day, they found a basket under a tree. The basket had many things inside. Some things were soft, some things were hard, some things were shiny, some things were dull.
"Wow, look at this basket!" Tom said. "It has so many different things. Can we play with them?"
"Sure, let's play with them," Lily said. "But we have to share. You can have one thing, and I can have one thing. Then we can swap."
Tom and Lily picked one thing each from the basket. Tom picked a ball. It was soft and red. Lily picked a ring. It was hard and shiny. They played with their things for a while. Then they wanted to swap.
"Can I have your ring?" Tom asked. "It is shiny and pretty. I want to see how it looks on my finger."
"OK, you can have my ring," Lily said. "But can I have your ball? It is soft and bouncy. I want to see how high it can go."
Tom and Lily swapped their things. But they were not happy. Tom's finger was too big for the ring. It hurt and it got stuck. Lily's ball was too small for her hand. It slipped and it rolled away.
"Ow, ow, ow!" Tom cried. "The ring is too tight. It won't come off. Help me, Lily!"
"Oh no, oh no, oh no!" Lily cried. "The ball is too fast. It went into the road. Help me, Tom!"
Tom and Lily ran to each other. They tried to help each other. But they could not. The ring was too hard to pull. The ball was too far to catch. They were scared and sad.
Then they heard a voice. It was a woman. She came from the tree. She had a hat and a coat. She looked kind and wise.
"Hello, children," she said. "I see you found my basket. It has many different things. But they are not for playing. They are for learning. Each thing has a story and a lesson. Do you want to hear them?"
Tom and Lily nodded. They wanted to hear the stories and the lessons. They wanted to get the ring off and the ball back. They wanted to be happy again.
The woman smiled. She took the ring from Tom's finger. She took the ball from the road. She put them back in the basket. Then she sat down with Tom and Lily. She began to talk. She told them stories and lessons. She told them about the different things in the basket. She told them how to be kind, curious, brave, and wise. Tom and Lily listened. They learned. They thanked the woman. They hugged each other. They were happy again.

Ben liked to play with his mom's things. He liked to look at her shiny rings, her soft scarves, and her big calendar. The calendar had many pictures of animals and flowers. Ben wanted to see them better, so he took the calendar to his room.
He put the calendar on his bed and opened it. He saw a picture of a lion with a big mane. He touched the lion and said, "Roar!" He saw a picture of a rose with many petals. He smelled the rose and said, "Ah!" He saw a picture of a whale with a big tail. He splashed the whale and said, "Splash!"
But then he saw a picture of a button with a red light. He did not know what it was, but it looked attractive. He pressed the button and said, "Beep!" Suddenly, he felt a strange feeling. He looked at his hands and feet. They were getting smaller and smaller. He was shrinking!
He tried to scream, but his voice was too tiny. He tried to run, but his legs were too short. He tried to climb, but his arms were too weak. He was trapped on the bed, with the big calendar. He saw the lion, the rose, and the whale. They looked scary and hungry. They moved closer and closer to him. He closed his eyes and hoped it was a bad dream. But it was not. It was the end.

Sara and Tom are twins. They like to play outside. But today the weather is cold and rainy. Mom says they have to wear coats and boots.
"I don't want to wear this coat!" Sara says. "It is ugly and itchy. I want to wear my pink dress."
"You can't wear your dress, Sara," Tom says. "It is too wet and muddy. You will get sick and dirty. And your dress is expensive. Mom will be mad."
"I don't care," Sara says. "I want to look pretty. You are silly and boring. You always wear the same coat and boots."
Sara runs to her room and puts on her dress. She sneaks out of the door and goes to the yard. She jumps in a puddle and laughs.
Tom follows her and sees her dress. He is shocked and angry. He runs to her and tries to pull her back.
"Stop, Sara, stop!" he says. "You are ruining your dress. Come inside. Mom will be here soon."
"Leave me alone, Tom!" Sara says. "You are mean and rude. I don't want to play with you. Go away."

Tom and Anna liked to play music with their toys. Tom had a drum and Anna had a flute. They made sounds with their toys and tried to follow a rhythm. A rhythm is when you make sounds that go together and have a pattern.
One day, they decided to play music outside in the garden. They found a nice spot under a big tree and started to play. Tom banged his drum and Anna blew her flute. They had fun making their own rhythm.
But then, a big bird came and landed on the tree. The bird was very bossy. It did not like the music that Tom and Anna made. It started to squawk and screech very loudly. It wanted to stop them from playing.
"Shoo, shoo, go away!" Tom said to the bird. "We are playing music, you are making noise!"
"No, no, you go away!" the bird said to Tom. "You are making noise, I am singing!"
The bird and Tom argued and shouted. Anna did not like the noise. She wanted to play music with Tom. She had an idea. She took her flute and started to play a different rhythm. A rhythm that sounded like the bird's squawks and screeches.
The bird heard Anna's flute and stopped shouting. It was surprised and curious. It listened to Anna's rhythm and tried to copy it. It squawked and screeched along with Anna's flute.
Tom heard Anna's flute and the bird's squawks. He was surprised and curious too. He stopped banging his drum and listened to Anna's rhythm. He liked it. He took his drum and started to play a different rhythm. A rhythm that matched Anna's flute and the bird's squawks.
Anna, Tom and the bird played music together. They made a new rhythm. A rhythm that spread through the garden and made them happy. They were not bossy anymore. They were friends.

Tim and Sam were brothers who liked to play with their toys. One day, they found a big box of stickers in their room. They were very happy and wanted to stick them everywhere.
"Look, Sam, I have a sticker of a lion. I will put it on the wall," Tim said.
"No, Tim, you can't do that. Mom will be mad. She said the wall is not for stickers. Only paper is for stickers," Sam said.
But Tim did not listen. He spread the stickers all over the wall, the door, the window, and the bed. He thought it looked very pretty.
"Tim, stop it! You are making a mess. Mom will see and she will put us in jail," Sam said.
"Jail? What is jail?" Tim asked.
"Jail is a bad place where you can't play or have fun. You have to stay in a small room with bars and no toys. Mom will send us there if we are naughty," Sam said.
Tim was scared. He did not want to go to jail. He wanted to play and have fun. He looked at the wall and saw how many stickers he had used. He felt sorry.
"Sam, I'm sorry. I did not know. How can we fix it?" Tim asked.
Sam thought for a moment. He had an idea.
"Maybe we can peel off the stickers and put them back in the box. Then we can clean the wall with a cloth and some water. Maybe Mom will not notice," Sam said.
Tim and Sam worked together to remove the stickers and clean the wall. It was hard work, but they did it. They put the box of stickers away and hoped Mom would not find out.
When Mom came home, she did not see anything wrong. She hugged Tim and Sam and said she was glad they had a good day. Tim and Sam smiled and hugged her back. They were glad too. They decided to be more careful with their stickers next time.

Ben was hungry. He wanted toast for breakfast. He asked his mom, "Can I have toast, please?"
Mom said, "Yes, you can. But first, you have to brush your teeth and wash your face. Then you can have toast."
Ben nodded. He went to the bathroom. He brushed his teeth and washed his face. He was a good boy.
But when he came back to the kitchen, he saw something strange. His toast was gone. There was only a plate with some crumbs. He looked around. He saw a trail of crumbs on the floor. He followed the trail. He wondered, "Who took my toast?"
He wandered into the living room. He saw his dog, Spot, on the couch. Spot had something in his mouth. It was Ben's toast. Spot was chewing it. It looked tough. Ben was angry. He said, "Spot, you bad dog! You took my toast! That was mine!"
Spot looked at Ben. He wagged his tail. He dropped the toast. He licked Ben's face. He wanted to play. He did not know he did something wrong.
Ben was still hungry. He did not want the toast anymore. It was dirty and tough. He went back to the kitchen. He asked his mom, "Can I have something else, please?"
Mom said, "Of course, you can. How about some cereal and milk?"
Ben said, "Yes, please. That sounds good."
Mom smiled. She gave Ben some cereal and milk. She said, "Next time, don't leave your toast on the table. Spot likes toast, too. He is a sneaky dog."
Ben said, "I know. I will be careful. I love Spot, but he is a naughty dog."
Mom said, "I love Spot, too. But he needs to learn some manners."
They laughed. They ate their breakfast. They were happy.

Sam frowns. "But I want to play. I don't like to stay inside. It is boring."
Lily thinks for a moment. She has an idea. "I know what we can do. We can play dress-up. We can wear different clothes and pretend to be someone else. It will be fun."
Sam smiles. "That sounds good. What clothes do you have?"
Lily takes Sam to her room. She opens her closet. She has many clothes. She has dresses and skirts and shirts and pants and hats and shoes. She has clothes for cold days and clothes for hot days.
"Look, Sam. We can wear these clothes. They are for hot days. They are light and thin and cool. They will not make us sweat. I recommend these clothes."
Sam nods. He likes Lily's clothes. He picks a shirt with stripes and a hat with a star. Lily picks a dress with flowers and a necklace with beads. They put on the clothes. They look at each other. They laugh.
"You look funny, Sam. You look like a pirate."
"You look pretty, Lily. You look like a princess."

"Hello, swan," Anna said. "You are very pretty. Can we be your friends?"
The swan looked at them and nodded. It swam next to the raft and let Anna and Ben touch its feathers.
"Thank you, swan," Ben said. "You are very kind. Can we lend you our raft? You can sit on it and rest."
The swan smiled and climbed on the raft. It flapped its wings and made a soft sound. Anna and Ben were happy to share their raft with the swan. They paddled the raft along the river and enjoyed the sunny day.

One day, they were playing catch in the living room. They were careful not to hit the furniture. The furniture is big and hard and has things on it. Mom and Dad do not like it when they break things. They want the furniture to stay normal.
But then, Tom threw the ball too hard and too high. Sara jumped to catch it, but she could not reach it. The ball flew over her head and hit the lamp on the table. The lamp fell down and broke. The glass made a loud noise and a mess.
Mom and Dad heard the noise and came to see what happened. They were not happy. They told Tom and Sara to stop playing catch in the living room. They said it was not safe or smart. They said they had to clean up the mess and fix the lamp. They said they had to play catch outside or in their room.

Dad smiled and hugged them. He said, "I'm sorry, my dear. The pot does not have beef in it. It has beans. Mom cooked them for dinner. She locked the pot to keep them warm. She left a note for me. She said we can eat some bread and cheese for lunch. And some fruit and milk. Do you like that?"
Tom and Lily nodded. They felt a little disappointed. But they were glad to see their dad. They knew their mom worked hard at the farm. They knew they were poor. But they loved their family. They followed their dad to the table. They ate some bread and cheese. And some fruit and milk. They thanked their dad for the food. They waited for their mom to come back.

Sara and Ben like to play in the creek. They splash and run and look for fish. Sometimes they find frogs and snails and rocks. They have fun in the water.
One day, they see a big mud puddle near the creek. They want to jump in it and get dirty. They run to the puddle and jump and laugh. They make mud pies and mud balls and mud hats. They are very dirty.
Mom sees them and says, "Oh no! You are all muddy! You need to wipe off the mud and take a bath!" She gives them a towel and tells them to wipe their faces and hands and feet. They try to wipe off the mud, but it is sticky and hard. They still have mud on them.
Mom says, "Come on, let's go to the creek and wash off the mud. The creek is nice and clean and cool." She takes them to the creek and helps them wash off the mud. They feel the water on their skin and hair. They see the fish and frogs and snails and rocks. They say, "Thank you, Mom. The creek is nice."
Mom says, "You're welcome, Sara and Ben. I'm glad you had fun in the creek. But next time, please stay away from the mud puddle. It is not nice." They nod and hug Mom. They are happy and clean.

Tom liked to go to the barber with his dad. The barber had a cool chair that went up and down, and a big mirror, and a lot of scissors and combs. Tom liked to watch the barber cut his dad's hair and make him look neat.
One day, Tom wanted to be like the barber. He found some scissors and a comb in his mom's drawer, and he sneaked into his sister's room. His sister was sleeping on her bed, with her long hair spread on the pillow. Tom thought he could give her a nice haircut, like the barber did for his dad.
He took the scissors and the comb, and started to cut his sister's hair. He cut it very short, and made it look funny. He did not know how to use the scissors and the comb well, and he hurt his sister's head. His sister woke up and screamed. She saw her hair on the floor, and on Tom's hands. She was very angry and sad.
Mom and dad heard the scream, and ran to the room. They saw what Tom had done, and they were very shocked and upset. They scolded Tom, and took him and his sister to the barber. The barber tried to fix his sister's hair, but he could not make it long again. He said it would take a long time to grow back. His sister cried, and Tom felt very sorry.
The moral of the story is: do not play with scissors and combs, and do not cut other people's hair. You could hurt them, and make them unhappy. Only the barber can cut hair, because he knows how to do it well. You should respect other people's things, and ask before you touch them.

Tom was a little boy who liked to play with his toys. He had many toys, but his favorite was a red car. He liked to zoom the car around the floor and make loud noises. He also liked to put the car in his mouth and bite it.
One day, Tom was playing with his car in his room. He was having fun, but he was also tired. He did not want to stop playing, so he did not listen to his mom when she called him for dinner. He put the car in his mouth and lay down on his bed.
Soon, Tom fell asleep with the car in his mouth. He did not know that the car had a small wheel that could come off. While he was sleeping, the wheel came off and went into his throat. Tom started to choke and cough. He woke up and felt scared and hurt.
His mom heard him and ran to his room. She saw the car in his mouth and the wheel in his throat. She quickly took the car out of his mouth and helped him spit out the wheel. She hugged him and took him to the doctor.
The doctor checked Tom and said he was lucky. He said that the wheel could have hurt him more if it stayed in his throat. He told Tom not to put toys in his mouth, because they are not food. He said that toys are for playing, not for eating.
Tom learned his lesson. He said sorry to his mom and thanked the doctor. He promised not to put toys in his mouth again. He also promised to listen to his mom when she called him for dinner. He realized that playing is fun, but eating and sleeping are important too. He was a good boy after that.

Tom and Mia were playing in the park. They liked to run, jump and slide on the grass and the swings. They saw a big tree with many leaves and branches. They wanted to see what was behind the tree.
They ran to the tree and looked behind it. They saw a big pile of sticks and stones. Some of the sticks were long and sharp. They looked like spears. Tom and Mia were curious. They wanted to touch the spears.
"Look, Mia, spears!" Tom said. He picked up one of the spears and held it in his hand. He felt the pointy end. It was hard and cold.
"Be careful, Tom, you might hurt yourself!" Mia said. She picked up another spear and looked at it. She saw some marks and drawings on the wood. They looked like animals and people.
"Wow, Mia, look at these!" Tom said. He saw the same marks and drawings on his spear. He wondered who made them and why.
"Maybe they are very old, Tom. Maybe someone left them here a long time ago." Mia said. She wanted to know more about the spears and the marks.
They decided to take the spears with them and show them to their mom and dad. They thought they had made a big discovery. They were very happy and excited.
They ran back to the grass and the swings. They saw their mom and dad sitting on a bench. They waved at them and shouted.
"Mom, dad, look what we found!" Tom and Mia said. They held up the spears and showed them to their mom and dad.
Their mom and dad looked surprised and worried. They got up from the bench and walked to Tom and Mia. They took the spears from their hands and looked at them closely.
"Where did you get these, Tom and Mia?" Their mom asked. She sounded serious and scared.
"Behind the big tree, mom. There was a pile of sticks and stones. Some of the sticks were spears. They have marks and drawings on them. We wanted to show you. We made a discovery!" Tom and Mia said. They smiled and hoped their mom and dad would be proud of them.
Their mom and dad looked at each other and frowned. They did not smile. They did not look proud. They looked angry and sad.
"Tom and Mia, these are not spears. These are arrows. They are very dangerous. They can hurt people and animals. They are not for playing. They are for fighting. Someone left them here because they were in a war. A war is when people are very mad and mean to each other. A war is very bad and sad. You should not touch these arrows. You should not take them with you. You should leave them where they are. Do you understand?" Their dad said. He sounded stern and loud.
Tom and Mia felt confused and scared. They did not understand what a war was. They did not understand why the arrows were bad and sad. They did not understand why their mom and dad were angry and sad. They did not like the arrows anymore. They felt a bitter taste in their mouths.
"Yes, dad, we understand. We are sorry, dad. We did not know, dad." Tom and Mia said. They nodded and looked down.
Their mom and dad hugged them and kissed them. They told them they loved them and they were not mad at them. They told them they were brave and smart and they did make a discovery. They told them they would explain more about the arrows and the war when they got home. They told them they would find something else to play with in the park.
Tom and Mia felt a little better. They still felt bitter, but they also felt loved. They hugged and kissed their mom and dad back. They said they loved them too. They said they were sorry again. They said they wanted to play something else.
Their mom and dad smiled and nodded. They took the arrows and put them back behind the tree. They told Tom and Mia to stay away from them. They took their hands and walked with them to the grass and the swings. They helped them find a ball and a kite. They played with them and laughed with them. They had fun in the park. They forgot about the arrows and the war. They were happy again.

"Hello, who are you?" Lily asked.
"I'm Mimi, I live here," the creature said.
"What do you eat?" Ben asked.
"I eat cheese, but I can't find any," Mimi said.
"Cheese? On the moon?" Lily asked.
"Yes, the moon is made of cheese, but it's very tough and hard to get," Mimi said.
"Maybe we can help you," Ben said.
He took out a knife and a plate from his rocket and cut a piece of cheese from the moon. He put it on the plate and gave it to Mimi.
"Here, try this," he said.
Mimi took a bite and smiled.
"Mmm, this is good, thank you!" Mimi said.
"You're welcome," Ben said.
Lily took out a cup and a bottle of water from her rocket and poured some water into the cup. She gave it to Mimi.
"Here, drink this," she said.
Mimi drank the water and sighed.
"Ah, this is refreshing, thank you!" Mimi said.
"You're welcome," Lily said.
Ben and Lily smiled and sat with Mimi. They talked and played and became friends.

But then, Tom saw something that made him very frightened. It was a big dog, with black fur and sharp teeth. It was barking and jumping and pulling on a rope.

Once upon a time, there was a wave in the ocean. The wave was made from water and it was so big that it bounced really high.
The wave looked for something to latch onto so it could stay safe, and it found an anchor. The anchor was made from metal and it was very strong, so it kept the wave from bouncing too much.
The wave was feeling happy and secure, but then something strange happened - the wave started to turn pale! It was strange because usually waves are blue but this one was turning white.
The wave asked the anchor what had happened, and the anchor said that the wave had used up all of its energy - so it had to take a nap. So the wave rested until it had enough energy to bounce again.

“Daddy, do you know that I love you?”
“Yes, I do, Molly. I know,” said Daddy.

Lily and Sam helped Mom measure the flour, the sugar, the eggs, and the milk. They poured them into the bowl and stirred with a big spoon. Mom added some vanilla and some chocolate chips.

Lila wanted to soar like a bird. She loved to watch them fly high in the sky, with their wings spread wide. She wished she had wings too, so she could join them and see the world from above.
One day, she saw a big plane in the air. It looked like a metal bird, but much louder and faster. She wondered who was inside, and where they were going. She ran to her mom and asked, "Mom, can we go on a plane someday?"
Mom smiled and hugged her. "Maybe, Lila. But planes are not for everyone. Some people are afraid of heights, or get sick on planes. And some people have to wear uniforms and work on planes, like pilots and flight attendants. They have to take care of the passengers and the plane, and follow many rules."
Lila thought about that. She did not like rules, or getting sick, or being afraid. But she still wanted to soar. She asked, "Mom, can I be a pilot when I grow up?"
Mom kissed her forehead. "You can be anything you want, Lila. But you have to work hard, and learn a lot, and be brave. Being a pilot is not easy. Sometimes, planes have problems, or bad weather, or emergencies. Then, the pilot has to be calm and smart, and try to fix the situation. Otherwise, the plane and the people on it could be in danger, and feel helpless."
Lila felt a shiver in her spine. She did not like danger, or feeling helpless. She imagined being on a plane that was falling, or on fire, or lost. She felt scared, and hugged her mom tighter. She said, "Mom, I changed my mind. I don't want to be a pilot anymore. I just want to be with you."
Mom smiled and rocked her gently. "That's okay, Lila. You don't have to be a pilot, if you don't want to. You can still soar in your dreams, or in your imagination, or with your toys. You can still watch the birds, and the planes, and enjoy their beauty. And you can always be with me, my sweet girl. I love you, Lila."
Lila felt warm and safe in her mom's arms. She said, "I love you too, Mom. Thank you for being my mom."
They cuddled for a while, and watched the sky together. Lila still wanted to soar, but she was happy where she was. She knew that her mom was the best person to soar with.

Lily was a little dog who loved to sing. She sang when she was happy, she sang when she was sad, she sang when she was bored. She sang to the birds, the flowers, the sun and the moon. She sang all day long.
One day, she found a big bone in the park. She was very happy and ran to it. She picked it up with her mouth and started to sing. She sang a song about the bone, how tasty it was, how lucky she was, how much she liked it.
But then, she heard a loud growl behind her. She turned around and saw a big dog, bigger than her, with sharp teeth and angry eyes. The big dog wanted the bone. He barked at Lily and said, "Give me the bone, or I will bite you!"
Lily was frightened. She did not want to give up the bone, but she did not want to be bitten either. She did not know what to do. She looked at the big dog and said, "Please, can we share the bone? I found it first, but you can have some too. I don't want to fight with you."
The big dog was surprised. He had never heard a dog sing before. He had never heard a dog ask to share before. He was used to taking what he wanted by force. He looked at Lily and said, "You sing? Why do you sing?"
Lily said, "I sing because I love to sing. Singing makes me happy. Singing makes everything better. Do you want to sing with me?"
The big dog was curious. He had never tried to sing before. He said, "How do you sing?"
Lily said, "It's easy. You just open your mouth and make a sound. Like this: woof, woof, woof!"
The big dog said, "Woof, woof, woof?"
Lily said, "Yes, that's it! Now, let's sing a song about the bone. Like this: woof, woof, woof, we have a bone, woof, woof, woof, we are not alone, woof, woof, woof, we can be friends, woof, woof, woof, until the end!"
The big dog said, "Woof, woof, woof, we have a bone, woof, woof, woof, we are not alone, woof, woof, woof, we can be friends, woof, woof, woof, until the end!"
Lily and the big dog sang together. They sang louder and louder, until everyone in the park heard them. They sang until they were tired and hungry. Then, they ate the bone together, and shared it equally. They became friends, and decided to sing every day. They were happy.

Anna and Ben love to go to the park with their grandma. Grandma is elderly, but she likes to play with them and push them on the swings. Sometimes she tells them stories about when she was a little girl.
One day, they went to the park and saw a big boot on the grass. It was brown and dirty and had holes in it. Anna and Ben wondered who left it there and why. They decided to make up a story about the boot.
Anna said, "Maybe it belongs to a giant who lives in the woods. He was walking to the park to have a picnic, but he stepped on a thorn and it hurt his foot. He took off his boot and threw it away, but he forgot to take his sandwich with him."
Ben said, "Or maybe it belongs to a pirate who sailed to the park on his ship. He was looking for treasure, but he found a snake instead. He kicked the snake with his boot, but the snake bit his leg. He ran away and left his boot and his map behind."
Grandma listened to their stories and smiled. She said, "You have very good imaginations, my dears. But I think I know the real story of the boot. It belongs to Mr. Jones, the gardener. He works very hard to keep the park clean and beautiful. He has a pair of old boots that he wears when he mows the grass and digs the soil. He must have taken them off to rest his feet and forgot to put them back on. He will be looking for them soon."
Anna and Ben looked at the boot and nodded. They thought that was a nice story too. They decided to leave the boot where it was, so Mr. Jones could find it. They thanked grandma for taking them to the park and gave her a hug. They had a lot of fun and learned a lot of new words.

"Stop! Stop! You are making the sky dirty! You need to fix your car or get a new one! The sky is not a trash can! The sky is for clouds and birds and stars!"
The driver hears Sara and Tom and looks at the sky. He sees the gray and black thing and feels sorry. He did not know he was making the sky dirty. He says he is sorry and turns off his car. He says he will fix his car or get a new one. He says he likes the sky too and does not want to hurt it.
Sara and Tom are happy. They thank the driver and hug each other. They look at the sky and see it is getting clean and blue again. They smile and go back to play. They hope the sky will stay clean and beautiful forever.

Lily liked to number things. She numbered her toys, her books, her fingers and toes. She liked to say the numbers out loud and count them with her mouth. She thought numbers were fun and easy.
One day, Lily went to the park with her mom. She saw a big slide and wanted to go on it. She ran to the slide and climbed up the ladder. She looked down and saw many children waiting for their turn. She decided to number them. She said, "One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten!" She said it very loud with her mouth.
The children did not like it. They felt angry and sad. They said, "Stop it, Lily! You are rude and mean! You are not letting us play! You are taking too long!" They shouted at her with their mouths.
Lily felt scared and sorry. She did not mean to hurt their feelings. She just liked to number things. She realized that it was difficult to number people. People were not things. They had feelings and needs. She said, "I'm sorry, children. I did not know. I will not number you anymore. I will share the slide with you. Can we be friends?"
The children felt happy and glad. They said, "Thank you, Lily. We accept your sorry. We like to play with you. We can be friends." They smiled at her with their mouths.
Lily learned a lesson. She learned that numbers were fun and easy, but people were not. She learned to be kind and respectful to others. She learned to use her mouth for nice words, not rude ones. She had fun with her new friends at the park.

Lily did not like broccoli. She thought it was green and yucky. She always tried to hide it under her plate or give it to her dog. But her mom said broccoli was good for her and she had to eat it.
One day, mom made a big pot of soup for dinner. She put carrots, potatoes, chicken and broccoli in it. She said it was a warm and yummy soup. Lily looked at the soup and saw the green bits. She did not want to eat them.
But mom said she had a surprise for Lily. She said if Lily ate all her soup, she would get a special dessert. Lily loved dessert. She wondered what it was. She decided to try the soup.
She took a small spoonful and put it in her mouth. She tasted the carrots, potatoes and chicken. They were good. She did not taste the broccoli. She took another spoonful. She still did not taste the broccoli. She took a bigger spoonful. She felt something crunchy. It was the broccoli. She did not like it. But she wanted the dessert. She swallowed it quickly.
She managed to eat all her soup. She was proud of herself. She asked mom what the dessert was. Mom smiled and brought out a big bowl of ice cream. It was Lily's favorite flavor. It had chocolate and sprinkles on top. It was not an ordinary dessert. It was a special dessert.
Lily was happy. She thanked mom and ate her ice cream. She thought maybe broccoli was not so bad after all. She decided to try it again next time. But she still liked ice cream more.

Tom and Lily were playing in the attic. They liked to look at the old things that their grandma had. They found a box full of photos. They opened it and saw many faces. Some were happy, some were sad, some were funny.
"Who are these people?" Lily asked.
"They are our family, I think. Look, this is grandma when she was little. And this is grandpa with a big hat. And this is..." Tom stopped. He saw a photo that made him tremble. It was a scary photo. It was a man with a big beard and a mean look. He had a knife in his hand and blood on his shirt.
"Who is that?" Lily asked, looking at the photo.
"I don't know. He is scary. Maybe he is a bad man. Maybe he hurt someone." Tom said, feeling scared.
"Let's put the photo back. Maybe he will come out of the photo and get us." Lily said, feeling scared too.
They quickly put the photo back in the box and closed it. They ran out of the attic and down the stairs. They found their grandma in the kitchen.
"Grandma, grandma, we saw a scary photo in the attic. It was a man with a knife and blood. Who is he?" Tom and Lily asked, still trembling.
Grandma looked at them and smiled. She hugged them and said, "Don't worry, my dears. That photo is not scary. It is just a photo of your great-uncle Bob. He was a butcher. He cut meat for people to eat. He was a good man. He loved you very much. He gave you this photo when you were babies. He wanted you to remember him."
Tom and Lily felt better. They looked at each other and laughed. They realized they were silly. They were not afraid of the photo anymore. They thanked their grandma and went back to the attic. They looked at the other photos and learned more about their family. They had fun.

Tommy likes to taste new things. He likes to taste sweet things, like cake and candy. He likes to taste salty things, like chips and cheese. He likes to taste sour things, like lemon and pickle. But he does not like to taste bitter things, like coffee and broccoli.
One day, Tommy sees a big circle on the table. It is brown and shiny. He thinks it is a cookie. He wants to taste it. He takes a bite. But it is not a cookie. It is a coin. It tastes very bad. It tastes bitter and metal. Tommy spits it out. He makes a face. He says, "Yuck!"
Mommy sees Tommy. She sees the coin. She is not happy. She says, "Tommy, that is not a cookie. That is a coin. You should not taste coins. They are not food. They are money. You could get sick. You are very silly."
Tommy feels sorry. He says, "I'm sorry, Mommy. I thought it was a cookie. It looked like a cookie. I wanted to taste it. I did not know it was a coin. I will not taste coins again. I will only taste food."
Mommy hugs Tommy. She says, "It's okay, Tommy. I know you were curious. But you have to be careful. Not everything that looks like food is food. Some things are not for tasting. They are for other things. Like coins are for buying things. And circles are for drawing and playing. Here, I have a real cookie for you. It is sweet and yummy. You can taste it."
Tommy smiles. He says, "Thank you, Mommy. I like cookies. They taste good. They are my favorite food. I will not be silly again. I will only taste cookies and other food. And I will play with circles and other toys." He takes the cookie. He bites it. He says, "Mmm!"

Tom and Jen were playing in the bath. They liked to splash and make bubbles. Mom said they could stay a little longer, but soon it was time to get out.
"Come on, kids, it's getting late. I have your towels ready," Mom said.
Tom and Jen got out of the water and wrapped themselves in their towels. Tom had a blue towel and Jen had a pink one. They felt warm and cozy.
"Let's go to your room and put on your pajamas," Mom said.
But Tom had a naughty idea. He wanted to scare Jen. He hid behind the door and waited for Jen to come. He thought it would be funny.
Jen walked to the door, holding her towel. She did not see Tom. She was humming a song.
"Boo!" Tom shouted, jumping out from behind the door.
Jen screamed. She was scared. She dropped her towel and ran to Mom.
"Mom, Tom scared me!" Jen cried.
Mom hugged Jen and gave her a kiss. She was not happy with Tom.
"Tom, that was not nice. You made Jen scared. You should say sorry," Mom said.
Tom felt bad. He did not mean to make Jen scared. He just wanted to play.
"I'm sorry, Jen. I was just joking. Please don't be scared," Tom said.
Jen looked at Tom. She saw that he was sorry. She forgave him.
"It's okay, Tom. I'm not scared anymore. But don't do that again," Jen said.
Tom nodded. He gave Jen a hug. He picked up her towel and gave it to her.
"Here, Jen. This is your towel. It's pink and soft," Tom said.
Jen smiled. She took her towel and wrapped it around her. She felt warm and cozy again.
"Thank you, Tom. You are a good brother," Jen said.
Mom smiled too. She was glad that Tom and Jen made up. She took them to their room and helped them put on their pajamas. She tucked them in and kissed them good night.
"Sleep well, kids. I love you," Mom said.
Tom and Jen said, "I love you, Mom."
They closed their eyes and fell asleep. They dreamed of bubbles and songs. They were not scared anymore.

Tom and Sue are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they find a shiny thing on the ground. It is brown and heavy.
"What is this?" Tom asks.
"I don't know. Maybe it is a coin," Sue says.
They pick up the shiny thing and look at it. It has some letters and numbers on it, but they cannot read them.
"Let's take it to Mom. She can tell us what it is," Tom says.
They run to the bench where Mom is sitting. They show her the shiny thing.
"Mom, look what we found!" Sue says.
Mom takes the shiny thing and looks at it. She frowns.
"Where did you find this?" she asks.
"In the park, near the slide," Tom says.
Mom shakes her head.
"This is not a coin. This is a piece of copper. It is a metal that people use to make things like wires and pipes. But it is not good for you to touch it. It can make you sick," she says.
She puts the copper in a plastic bag and throws it in the trash.
"Sorry, kids. You can't keep this. It is dangerous. You have to wash your hands now," she says.
Tom and Sue feel sad and uncomfortable. They liked the shiny thing. They did not know it was bad.
They go to the fountain and wash their hands. Mom gives them a hug and a cookie.
"It's okay. You did not mean to do anything wrong. You were just curious. But you have to be careful with things you find in the park. Some of them can hurt you. Next time, ask me before you pick up anything," she says.
Tom and Sue nod. They understand. They say sorry to Mom. They eat their cookies and play with their ball. They forget about the copper. They are happy again.

Tim and Lily are twins who like to play in the park. They like to swing, run, and slide on the big slide. One day, they see a small mouse near the slide. The mouse is dirty and has a long tail.
"Look, a mouse!" Tim says. He wants to touch the mouse.
"No, Tim, don't touch it!" Lily says. She is afraid of the mouse. "It is dirty and it can bite you!"
But Tim does not listen to Lily. He runs to the mouse and tries to catch it. The mouse is scared and runs away. It runs up the slide and hides at the top.
Tim follows the mouse and climbs the slide. He reaches the top and sees the mouse. He smiles and reaches his hand to grab it.
But the mouse is clever and fast. It jumps over Tim's hand and slides down the slide. Tim loses his balance and slides down too. He slides very fast and bumps into Lily, who is waiting at the bottom.
"Ouch!" Tim and Lily say. They fall on the grass and rub their heads.
The mouse runs away and finds a hole in the fence. It is safe and happy.
Tim and Lily look at each other and start to laugh. They are not hurt, just dirty and silly.
They hug each other and say, "We are sorry, mouse. We won't bother you again."
They go back to their mom, who is sitting on a bench. She sees them and says, "What happened to you? You are so dirty!"
Tim and Lily tell her their story. She shakes her head and smiles. She says, "You are very brave, but also very naughty. Next time, be careful and listen to your sister. Now, let's go home and have a bath."
Tim and Lily nod and hold their mom's hand. They walk home and say goodbye to the park and the mouse. They learned their lesson and had fun.

"Hello, doggy!" Ben says. "You are so cute and fluffy!"
"Can we give you some water?" Mia asks. "You must be thirsty!"
They find a fountain and fill a cup with water. They bring the cup to the dog and hold it out. The dog sniffs the cup and then drinks the water. He wags his tail and licks Ben and Mia's faces.
"Thank you, kids!" a voice says. Ben and Mia look up and see a man with a hat and a badge. He is holding a leash. "You are very kind and helpful. This is my dog, Rex. He is a police dog. He helps me catch bad people who break the law."
"What is the law?" Ben asks.
"The law is a set of rules that everyone must follow to be good and safe," the man says. "For example, the law says you must not steal, or hurt, or lie."
"Oh, I see," Ben says. "We follow the law at home and at school. We share, and say sorry, and tell the truth."
"That's very good," the man says. "You are smart and good kids. Do you want to pet Rex some more?"
"Yes, please!" Mia says. She and Ben stroke Rex's fur and ears. Rex barks happily.
Suddenly, they hear a loud noise. They see a car speeding on the road. The car is ugly and dirty. It has a broken window and a dent. The man with the hat and the badge frowns.
"That's a bad car," he says. "The people in that car are breaking the law. They stole the car and they are driving too fast. They are dangerous. I have to stop them. Come on, Rex!"
He clips the leash to Rex's collar and runs to his own car. He turns on the siren and the lights. He drives after the bad car. Rex barks loudly.
"Wow!" Ben says. "That's so cool!"
"Be careful!" Mia says. "We hope you catch the bad people!"
Ben and Mia wave to the man and Rex as they zoom away. They hope they will see them again. They think Rex is the best dog ever. They go back to playing in the park. They follow the law and have fun.

But then, a man comes. He is angry. He has a hat and a coat. He says the radio is his.
"Hey, you kids! That's my radio! Give it back!" he shouts.
Anna and Ben are scared. They stop dancing. They look at the man.
"Sorry, mister. We didn't know. We just wanted to dance," Anna says.
"Sorry, nothing. You stole my radio. It's mine. Go away!" the man says. He grabs the radio and walks away.
