# The-Hive
Hello everyone. I am pilot-J, machine learning and robotics enthusiast. 

This repo contains links to all my implementations and projects - small and large. I usually work with neural nets and computer vision problems.
The following projects can work as beginners guide to many for - Basics of ML, Implemetation of NNs, Image processing using OpenCV and much more beyond this.

I am currently learning about deep pose estimation methods, NLP, data structures and route optimisation algorithms for aerial navigation (UAV).

I have strong hold on python and C++ with sound knowledge of data structures.
