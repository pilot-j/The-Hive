Hello everyone. I am pilot-J, machine learning and robotics enthusiast. I have strong programming skills in Python and C++ which explains my natural inclination towards the world of ML/DL. I have hands on experience with famous libraries like Tensorflow,Pytorch, NumPy, Pandas, Graphviz, ScikitLearn  and Keras.


This repo contains links to all my implementations and projects - small and large. I usually work with neural nets and computer vision problems.
The following projects can work as beginners guide to many for - Basics of ML, Implemetation of NNs, Hyperparameter tuning,  Image processing using OpenCV and much more beyond this.
I have previously build autonomous quadcopter that exposed me to the world of programmed navigation, edge and parallel computation and  path optimisation. This repo is an attempt to document, develop and learn useful applications of ML as well as conventional programming.

I am currently learning about deep pose estimation methods, NLP, data structures and route optimisation algorithms for aerial navigation (UAV).

Feel free to give feedback, share insights, and use this as a resource to complement your learning journey.
